# radiation-realms-POC

My proof of concept is a program, depicting a somewhat simplified version of the character creation system I intend to implement into the final project. I attempted to build such a thing, not necessarily because it was the hardest technology the project would have implemented (all the features I am considering are at least a little bit tricky). Rather, I believe that in a project like this one, a character creation system is a central feature that all the other features I decide to use will depend on, whatever they might be. If the character creation system does not work, then basically, the rest of the site becomes unfeasible, too.

I decided to build the program in HTML, because if you can build it in HTML, you can build it in most other programs as well, React included. Thankfully, there were no problems encountered that had to do with the system itself – mainly just small bugs that needed to be ironed out – simple problems that could be encountered on any attempt to build a website. Therefore, since the feature I have planned is not difficult (just a lot of work) I will continue to move forward with my project as intended.
